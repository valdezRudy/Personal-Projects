# Final Project 2
This project was created for my Data Analytics class. I was asked to find a dataset I could perform exploratory analysis on and my findings are inside of the ipynb file. I attempted to use linear regression techniques on some of my questions with some of the predictor variables in the table. Looking back on this project now, maybe a quadratic regression would have been better suited for some of my graphs, and I would have also picked a better dataset with more explanation between the variables.
